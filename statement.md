------Practice Question Generator------

Problem Statement
-
Students often struggle to revise regularly because they lack an easy way to access varied practice questions across multiple subjects. There is no simple tool that lets them quickly choose a subject, select a question type (MCQ, Fill in the Blanks, Short Answer, Long Answer), and practice instantly without searching online or using textbooks. They also miss immediate feedback for objective questions, which slows self-learning.
A lightweight, user-friendly system is needed to automatically deliver questions, offer customization, and provide quick correction for MCQ and fill-in questions while supporting reflective practice for long/short answers.

Scope of the Project
-
- Provide a simple terminal-based system for generating practice questions.
- Support four major subjects: Maths, Physics, Chemistry, and English.
- Offer multiple question types: MCQ, Fill in the Blanks, Short Answer, and Long Answer.
- Use a modular structure where each subject has its own question file for easy updates.
- Include a test script to ensure question modules work as expected.
- Keep the project lightweight and dependency-free (uses only the Python standard library).

Target Users
-
- Students who need quick and flexible revision across multiple subjects.
- Teachers who want a fast way to generate classroom practice questions.
- Beginners learning Python who want to study modular program structure.
- Anyone interested in a simple self-practice tool for academic subjects.
